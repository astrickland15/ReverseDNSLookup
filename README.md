# ReverseDNSLookup
Windows Forms App that checks whether IP addresses are setup with correct Reverse DNS

Written in C#,  you can enter as many IP addresses as you like.  The app will return the rDNS domain attached to each IP, and perform the reverse (show the IP attached to each domain).

The app will also display any IP that is not configured properly, and provides the option to write these IPs to a text file for further review.
